# Database-Management-system---Online-consultation-DB

### Overview:
This project is designed to transform healthcare services by providing a comprehensive Online Medical Consultation System. It aims to streamline essential processes like patient appointments, case management, and doctor-patient communication. The system employs an advanced Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) and SQL scripts to create a scalable and efficient database structure that supports key healthcare operations.

### Key Features:
Patient Management: Efficiently store and retrieve patient information, including medical history and contact details.
Doctor Scheduling: Simplify appointment management and doctor schedules.
Case Records: Maintain detailed records of patient cases, including prescriptions and doctor feedback.
Prescription Management: Track medication orders, dosages, and recommendations from doctors.
Feedback Integration: Collect and analyze patient feedback for continuous service improvement.
Symptom Specialization: Match patient symptoms to specialized doctors for accurate consultations.
### Database Design:
The system is built on a well-structured ERD to define key entities and their relationships:

### Core Entities:
PatientDetails, Doctor, Department, CaseRecord, PrescriptionDetails
Supporting Entities:
MedicationOrder, DoctorAppointmentSchedule, ConsultationRoom, PatientFeedback
The ERD ensures the database is scalable and efficient, enabling smooth data management and streamlined operations.

### SQL Implementation:
The SQL script creates relational tables with proper primary and foreign key relationships to maintain data integrity. Key features include:

Creation of relational tables for efficient data storage.
Advanced queries for real-time data retrieval and management.
Workflow automation for case assignments, prescription generation, and appointment scheduling.
Technology Stack:
Database: SQL
Modeling Tool: ERD designed using advanced data modeling principles.
Languages: SQL, Python (optional for future extensions)
Tools: PyCharm, Flask (for future web interface)
### How to Use:
Setup the Database: Run the SQL script (DAMG_PROJECT_TEAM4.sql) in your preferred SQL environment to create the necessary tables and database structure.
Populate the Data: Populate the tables with sample data for testing and demonstration purposes.
Interact with the System: You can either use SQL queries directly to manage the data or integrate the system with a front-end/backend for real-time interactions.
